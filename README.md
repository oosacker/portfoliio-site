# Portfoilo site for Natsuki

## Uses MDBootstrap UI library

* React-Router is used for the navbar and page routing
* React Context hook is used to handle the modal display and hide (it needs to be controlled from more than one component)
* Some hacks had to be used for the navbar to make the links get highlighted (change active state) because MDBootstrap doesn't easily allow this
* https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack was used to deploy the app to Heroku
